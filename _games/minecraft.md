REAL Minecraft 1.8 running in your browser brought to you by EaglerCraft! If it runs like shit try changing your video settings or maybe try playing [ClassiCube]({{ '/games/classicube' | relative_url }}) instead.

Now includes Public Game Codes, where you can share your shared world codes  with anyone using the site.
